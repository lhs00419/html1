        >An air force</a
      >

      in the broadest sense is the national military branch that primarily
      conducts aerial warfare. More specifically, it is the branch of a nation's
      armed services that is responsible for aerial warfare as distinct from an
      army or navy. Typically, air forces are responsible for gaining control of
      the air, carrying out strategic and tactical bombing missions, and
      providing support to land and naval forces often in the form of aerial
      reconnaissance and close air support.

      The term air force may also refer to a tactical air force or numbered air
      force, which is an operational formation either within a national air
      force or comprising several air components from allied nations. Air forces
      typically consist of a combination of fighters, bombers, helicopters,
      transport planes and other aircraft.

      Many air forces may command and control other air defence assets such as
      anti-aircraft artillery, surface-to-air missiles, or anti-ballistic
      missile warning networks and defensive systems. Some air forces are also
      responsible for operations of the military space and intercontinental
      ballistic missiles (ICBM). Some nations, principally countries who
      modelled their militaries along Soviet lines, have or had an air defence
      force which is organizationally separate from their air force.
