      An army (from Latin arma "arms, weapons" via Old French armée, "armed"
      [feminine]), ground force or land force is a fighting force that fights
      primarily on land. In the broadest sense, it is the land-based military
      branch, service branch or armed service of a nation or state. It may also
      include aviation assets by possessing an army aviation component. Within a
      national military force, the word army may also mean a field army.

      In some countries, such as France and China, the term "army", especially
      in its plural form "armies", has the broader meaning of armed forces as a
      whole, while retaining the colloquial sense of land forces. To
      differentiate the colloquial army from the formal concept of military
      force, the term is qualified, for example in France the land force is
      called Armée de terre, meaning Land Army, and the air and space force is
      called Armée de l'Air et de l’Espace, meaning Air and Space Army. The
      naval force, although not using the term "army", is also included in the
      broad sense of the term "armies" — thus the French Navy is an integral
      component of the collective French Armies (French Armed Forces) under the
      Ministry of the Armies. A similar pattern is seen in China, with the
      People's Liberation Army (PLA) being the overall military, the land force
      being the PLA Ground Force, and so forth for the PLA Air Force, the PLA
      Navy, and other branches.
