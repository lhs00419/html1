        >A navy, naval force, or maritime force</a
      >

      is the branch of a nation's armed forces principally designated for naval
      and amphibious warfare; namely, lake-borne, riverine, littoral, or
      ocean-borne combat operations and related functions. It includes anything
      conducted by surface ships, amphibious ships, submarines, and seaborne
      aviation, as well as ancillary support, communications, training, and
      other fields. The strategic offensive role of a navy is projection of
      force into areas beyond a country's shores (for example, to protect
      sea-lanes, deter or confront piracy, ferry troops, or attack other navies,
      ports, or shore installations).

      The strategic defensive purpose of a navy is to frustrate seaborne
      projection-of-force by enemies. The strategic task of the navy also may
      incorporate nuclear deterrence by use of submarine-launched ballistic
      missiles. Naval operations can be broadly divided between riverine and
      littoral applications (brown-water navy), open-ocean applications
      (blue-water navy), and something in between (green-water navy), although
      these distinctions are more about strategic scope than tactical or
      operational division.
